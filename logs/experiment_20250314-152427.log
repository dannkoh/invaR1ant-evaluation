To generate the constraints as seen in the examples provided, we need to recognize the pattern where each `inX` is greater than every `inY` for all `Y < X`. Additionally, we need a final condition that `in` is greater than all prior `inX` values. Here's the Python function that generates such constraints in SMT-LIB format for a given `N`:

```python
def generate_constraints(N: int) -> str:
    assert_conditions = []

    # Generate conditions for inX > inY (for all Y < X)
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(i):
            assert_conditions.append(f"( >  in{i} in{j})")

    # Add condition for in > inX for all X
    for i in range(N):
        assert_conditions.append(f"( >  in in{i})")

    # Combine all conditions with 'and'
    combined_assertions = " ".join(assert_conditions)
    constraints = f"(assert (and {combined_assertions}))"

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(constraints)
```

### Explanation:
- **Inner Loop Logic**: For every index `i` from 1 to `N-1`, generate conditions where `inX` (for a current `X` i.e., `i`) should be greater than all previous indices `inY` values (`Y < X`).
- **Last Condition**: Ensure `in` is greater than all `inX` values from `in0` to `inN-1`.
- **Combining Conditions**: All these individual conditions are combined using the `and` logical SMT-LIB construct, which ensures that all conditions must be satisfied for the input set to be valid.

This function constructs an assert constraint string in SMT-LIB format for `N` inputs. It follows the observed pattern from the given examples: each input `in{i}` should be greater than all previous inputs `in{j}` (for `j < i`), and the input `in` should be greater than all `in{i}`. The constraints are formatted to create a valid SMT-LIB assertion utilizing the pattern discovered, ensuring scalability for any input size `N`.

Below is the Python function implementing the logic to generate a valid SMT-LIB format assert constraint string for any given input size `N`. The constraints are generated in such a way that each element `inK` (where `0 <= K < N`) is greater than all previous elements. Afterward, the element `in` is greater than all elements `inK`.

```python
def generate_constraints(N: int) -> str:
    constraints = ""
    # Building constraints for the first N elements
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(i):
            constraints += f"( >  in{i} in{j}) "

    # Adding the constraint for 'in' to be greater than all elements 'inK'
    for k in range(N):
        constraints += f"( >  in in{k}) "

    # Wrapping all constraints in nested 'and' statements
    constraints = "(assert " + " ".join(["(and"] * ((N * (N - 1)) // 2 + N)) + " " + constraints + ")" + ")" * ((N * (N - 1)) // 2 + N)

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
print(constraints)
```

### Explanation
- **Loop Arrangement**: The function uses nested loops to construct a series of constraint expressions, where each input `inK` (for K = 1 to N-1) must be greater than all preceding inputs `inJ` (for J = 0 to K-1).
- **Hierarchy Check**: After ensuring that each `inK` is greater than its predecessors, the final step is to assert that the element `in` is greater than each `inK`.
- **Combination of Conditions**: All these conditions are wrapped with nested `(and ...)` constraints to form a comprehensive assertion that can accurately model the desired behavior for any arbitrary `N`. The number of nested `(and ...)` expressions corresponds to the number of conditions generated.
- **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted into a single SMT-LIB compatible `(assert ...)` statement.
